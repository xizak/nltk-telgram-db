# nltk-telgram-db

This project contains two guides: **NLTK Guide** and **Telegram Group Analysis**.

## NLTK Guide

The NLTK guide provides examples and instructions on how to use NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for various text analysis tasks. It covers the following topics:

1. Compiling Data: Demonstrates how to compile data from a corpus, remove stop words, and analyze frequency distributions.
2. Creating Frequency Distributions: Shows how to create frequency distributions and analyze the most common words.
3. Extracting Concordance and Collocations: Explains how to extract concordance and collocations from a text.
4. Pre-Trained Sentiment Analyzer: Introduces VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) for sentiment analysis.
5. Customizing NLTK's Sentiment Analysis: Demonstrates how to customize NLTK's sentiment analysis by excluding unwanted words and training a classifier.

## Telegram Group Analysis

The Telegram Group Analysis guide focuses on analyzing text data from Telegram groups. It includes the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Describes how to collect data from Telegram groups using the Telegram API.
2. Preprocessing: Covers data preprocessing steps such as removing special characters, stop words, and performing tokenization.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Shows how to perform sentiment analysis on the collected text data using NLTK or other libraries.
4. Topic Modeling: Explains how to apply topic modeling techniques such as LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify the main topics in the group conversations.
5. Visualization: Demonstrates various visualization techniques to represent the analysis results, such as word clouds, bar charts, and network graphs.
